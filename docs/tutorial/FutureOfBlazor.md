# Future of Blazor
Microsoft Dot Net have multiple platforms and each serves for different purpose,

* .Net Framework
* .Net Core
* Mono
* Xamarin
* UWP (Universal Windows platform) 
* Unity

All these platforms comes under .Net Standard 2.0. Blazor currently runs on Mono runtime in browser (Mono.wasm) and its part of .Net Standard 2.0

Microsoft have big plans to migrate all its platforms into one unified platform called .Net 5(.Net Core vNext).

Blazor not only works in Server / Client side web applications but also in cross platform desktop applications using Electron.

**So, excited to see Blazor plays a major role in future and alternate to javascript using .Net 5** :smile:.
